# Team-X

HackTX19

We use geo-tagged Twitter Data to track a wildfire and predict what areas are at most risk in the next 12 hrs. We scraped datat from Twitter and implemented a time series and random walk model to predict the fire's trajectories. 
Our team members are Ananya, Syed, Jess, Hayeong, Martin and Eric. Please find a presentation of our project!
